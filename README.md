# Weather Dataset Clustering & Heart Disease Classification

## Project Description
This project consists of two main analyses:
1. **Clustering Weather Dataset**: Grouping weather data based on specific characteristics using clustering techniques.
2. **Heart Disease Classification**: Predicting the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on medical datasets using classification techniques.

## Datasets
- **Weather Dataset**: Contains information about temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, and other weather variables.
- **Heart Disease Dataset**: Contains health features such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, heart rate, and other medical variables.

## Methodology
### 1. Weather Dataset Clustering
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning data, normalization, and dimensionality reduction if needed.
- **Clustering Methods**: K-Means, DBSCAN, or Hierarchical Clustering.
- **Model Evaluation**: Using Silhouette Score and Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- **Results Visualization**: Scatter plots and heatmaps for further analysis.

### 2. Heart Disease Classification
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, normalization, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Feature Selection**: Selecting the most relevant features using statistical methods or feature selection algorithms.
- **Models Used**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Neural Network (optional)
- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
  - ROC Curve and AUC Score
  
## Installation & Usage
1. **Clone Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/project-analysis.git
   cd project-analysis
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run Analysis**
   ```bash
   python clustering_weather.py
   python classification_heart_disease.py
   ```

## Technologies Used
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for data exploration)

## Results & Conclusion
The results from clustering and classification analyses will be summarized in the final report, with interpretations of the patterns found in the datasets.
